Kallisto pseudoalignment rates are lower than Hisat2.  This might be due
to the fact that Kallisto aligns to a transcriptome while hisat2 aligns
to a genome, and the trascriptome for these species is incomplete.

Kallisto's p_unique (percent mapped to exactly one target) is also low.
Perhaps due to redundancy in the transcriptome?

    95.02% overall alignment rate

STAR:

    I was unable to run the STAR aligner due to its extreme memory
    requirements.  128 GiB RAM (the most on any of my cluster nodes)
    was not enough to build the index.
    
    I looked into using UWM HPC resources, but they're in bad shape.
    Some are running antiquated operating systems on which it is difficult
    to install modern tools, while others with a newer OS are misconfigured
    so that we do not have access to all available RAM.
